Data Cleaning using Python and SQL
Here I took the sample data in csv format from Housing Firm (nashvillehousing), Load the data to MySQL database using Python module and clean the data using SQL

1. Since loading 9 MB file through MySQL table import wizrd takes a lot of time, we can write a simple python script that will import the data into MYSQL database quickly
2. Further data cleaning process was carried out using SQL

please refer data_import.py for inserting file data to DB and data_cleaning.sql to carry out data cleaning process
